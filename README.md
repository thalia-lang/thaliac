## Building and Installation

### Dependencies
- C++ compiler (gcc, clang, ...)
- Build system generator: cmake
- Package manager: vcpkg 

### Building the project
To set the compiler that will be used, you can use:
```sh
# for clang
export CC=/usr/bin/clang
export CXX=/usr/bin/clang++

# for gcc
export CC=/usr/bin/gcc
export CXX=/usr/bin/g++
```

To set the path to the directory where vcpkg is installed, you can use:
```sh
export VCPKG_ROOT=/path/to/vcpkg
```

To compile the project, we first need to make 'build.sh' script to be executable with:
```sh
chmod +x ./build.sh
```

Now, we can use 'build.sh' script to compile the project:
```sh
./build.sh
```

### Running tests
If everything went well with the compilation we can run the executable:
```sh
./test
```

### Running the program
If everything went well with the compilation we can run the executable:
```sh
./thalia
```

### Installing
To install the app run:
```sh
sudo make install
```
By default the app will be installed in `/usr/local/bin/` directory.
